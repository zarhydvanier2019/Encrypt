My name is Hydar, and I am currently a grade 11 student at Vanier. 
I currently am not sure of what I will pursue in terms of a profession in the future. 
However, I do know that computer science will be a significant part of most careers of choice going forward anyways, so even if 
computer science isn't my primary choice, I still recognise it as a significant skill similar to numerical literacy.
While I would prefer a career in biochemistry, my secondary choice remains in the computer science field.
I would ideally do a masters program at U of T or Mcmaster, completing an undergrad thesis in the fourth year. 
My focus would either be cybersecurity or Artificial Intelligence in the quantum computing age.
Many ancticipate the workplace to be levelled on a scale similar to the industrial revolution, and these predictions often 
overlook the acceleration in automation caused by the rise of quantum computers. These changes are expected to cripple encryption and most other forms of cyber security, while automation is likely to keep accelerating in growth, making these important topics in the next century
